NBFC-Linux Endpoints
====================

This directory contains the endpoint URLs used to access the NBFC-Linux server.

The endpoints are stored as plain text files and are used by the NBFC-Linux
client for various functions, such as uploading firmware.

Since these endpoints may change over time, they are not hardcoded in the
source code. Storing them here allows updates without requiring code changes
or recompilation.

Each file in this directory contains a single endpoint URL.
