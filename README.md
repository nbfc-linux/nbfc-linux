NoteBook FanControl
===================

This is a C port of [Stefan Hirschmann's](https://github.com/hirschmann) [NoteBook FanControl](https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc).

It provides the same utilities with the same interfaces as the original NBFC, although the implementation differs.

The [service](doc/nbfc_service.md) and the [probing tool](doc/ec_probe.md) are written in C.
The [client](doc/nbfc.md) is written in Python.
Another [client](doc/nbfc.md) has also been [written in C](src/client.c).

Installation
------------

- Arch Linux:
  - Either via AUR (`yaourt -S nbfc-linux`)
  - Or by using the PKGBUILD [nbfc-linux-git](pkgbuilds/nbfc-linux-git/PKGBUILD)

- With Nix:
  - With legacy nix (`nix-env -if .`)
  - With nix flakes (`nix profile install`)
  - [On NixOS](nixos-installation.md)

- In general:
  - `make && sudo make install`

Getting started
---------------

When running NBFC for the first time, you need to give it a configuration file for your laptop model.

If you are lucky, `sudo nbfc config --set auto` will find a matching one and set it.

`sudo nbfc config --recommend` (requires `dmidecode`) will give a list of configuration files that may match your laptop.

With `sudo nbfc config --set <MODEL>` a configuration is selected.

`sudo nbfc start` will start the service.

It can be queried by `sudo nbfc status -a`.

If you wish `nbfc_service` to get started on boot, use `sudo systemctl enable nbfc_service`.

- The original NBFC service is queried and controlled by the client using TCP/IP. - NBFC Linux does not implement any "real" IPC. Information about the service can be queried by reading its state file. The client controls the service by simply rewriting its configuration file and reloading it.

- The original NBFC service adjusts the fan speeds in intervals of `EcPollIntervall` according to `TemperatureThresholds`. - NBFC Linux directly sets the fan speed (also according to `TemperatureThresholds`).

- The original NBFC service selects a TemperatureThreshold and applies its `FanSpeed` when the temperature exceeds its `UpThreshold`. In contrast, NBFC Linux will select the *next* TemperatureThreshold and apply its `FanSpeed` when the temperature exceeds the *current* `UpThreshold`. The provided config files have been reconfigured to account for this change, so that they provide the same behaviour as the original NBFC service. If you have a custom config file that works well with the original service, you can port it to NBFC Linux using the [provided tool](/tools/config_to_json.py) (requires python3-lxml).

- NBFC Linux dropped the `Autostart` option, since it relies on the systemd service file only.

Troubleshooting
---------------
The preferred way of running nbfc is using the `ECSysLinux` implementation, which depends on the `ec_sys` kernel module.
There is also an alternative implementation which uses `/dev/port`, called `ec_linux`.
It can be specified on the commandline using `--embedded-controller=ec_linux` and permanently set in `/etc/nbfc/nbfc.json` with `"EmbeddedControllerType": "ec_linux"`.

Many Linux distributions do not provide the `ec_sys` module, and the module should be compiled manually. Alternatively, the [`acpi_ec`](https://github.com/MusiKid/acpi_ec) module can be used. The `acpi_ec` module comes with a DKMS config script, which automatically rebuilds the `acpi_ec` module when a new kernel is installed and supports running NBFC with Secure Boot and Lockdown Kernel. To compile with the `acpi_ec` module, use the command:

`make EMBEDDED_CONTROLLER=acpi_ec`

Shell autocompletion
--------------------

NBFC-Linux comes with shell completion scripts for bash, fish and zsh.

```
~ $ nbfc_service <TAB>
--config-file          -c  -- Use alternative config file (default /etc/nbfc/nbfc.json)
--debug                -d  -- Enable tracing of reads and writes of the embedded controller
--embedded-controller  -e  -- Specify embedded controller to use
--fork                 -f  -- Switch process to background after sucessfully started
--help                 -h  -- show this help message and exit
--readonly             -r  -- Start in read-only mode
--state-file           -s  -- Write state to an alternative file (default /var/run/nbfc_service.state.json)

~ $ nbfc <TAB>
config   -- List or apply configs
help     -- Show help
restart  -- Restart the service
set      -- Control fan speed
start    -- Start the service
status   -- Show the service status
stop     -- Stop the service
```
